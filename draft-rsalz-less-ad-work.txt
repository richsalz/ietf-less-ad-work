                  Making Less Work for Area Directors
                    draft-rsalz-less-ad-work-latest

Abstract

   Anecdotally, every IESG complains about the Area Director (AD)
   workload, and says that it takes the first full term to understand
   the job.  Empirically, the AD workload is high sometimes causing
   backlogs in processing of Internet-Drafts and stressing the ADs.

   Empirically, the AD workload is high sometimes causing backlogs in
   processing of Internet-Drafts and stressing the ADs.  This is
   evidenced by the limits applied to the number of pages on the regular
   IESG telechats, and by the number of documents waiting in excess of
   fifty days for initial AD review after a working group has requested
   publication.

   This document proposes a number of ways that the AD workload can be
   reduced.  It will be up to the IETF consensus process to determine
   which proposals to adopt.

   A major goal of this effort is to make it feasible for a wider
   diversity of people to volunteer as candidates for AD positions by
   reducing the barriers and costs to individuals and their employers.

1.  Introduction

   Anecdotally, every IESG complains about the Area Director (AD)
   workload, and says that it takes the first full term to understand
   the job.  This implies that a successful AD will need to serve at
   least two terms to be effective, making the role a commitment of at
   least four years.

   Empirically, the AD workload is high sometimes causing backlogs in
   processing of Internet-Drafts and stressing the ADs.  This is
   evidenced by the limits applied to the number of pages on the regular
   IESG telechats, and by the number of documents waiting in excess of
   fifty days for initial AD review after a working group has requested
   publication.

   This document proposes a number of ways that the AD workload can be
   reduced.  These proposals are intended for discussion and adoption
   either individually or in groups such that no one suggestion shall be
   blocked by discussions of the others.  It will be up to the IETF
   consensus process to determine which proposals to adopt.

   A major goal of this effort is to make it feasible for a wider
   diversity of people to volunteer as candidates for AD positions by
   reducing the barriers and costs to individuals and their employers.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

      *DISCUSSION* Probably delete this section.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  History of IESG Job Descriptions

   The IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom) appoints ADs to the IESG
   according to their judgement, but taking feedback from the community
   on the suitability of the candidates, and considering the job
   descriptions provided by the sitting IESG.  It is useful to look at
   the job descriptions provided to the NomCom over the years.

   In 2013, the first year for which the job description is preserved in
   the datatracker, the description said

      The basic IESG activities can consume between 15-40 hours a week.

   In 2017, this changed to

      The ability to contribute more time is useful, but if the NomCom
      should pick a few ADs who can only do 15 hrs/week on a routine
      basis, the IESG can cope with that.

   Starting with the 2018 NomCom, this changed to the following

      Many ADs allocate 15 hours or more per week...

   This boilerplate has been unchanged in the five years since then.

   At the same time (2018), the description added text to say

      Enough time must be allocated to manage approximately 10 to 15
      working groups, [and] to read on the order of 500 pages of
      internet-drafts every two weeks

   This text has also not changed in the last five years.

      *TODO:* Would be interesting to find out why this changed.

   The IESG secretary says that this past year (ending in March), the
   IESG has requested that agendas be limited to 400 pages.

      *TODO:* Get pagecounts for the past several years; maybe from the
      sodastream folks?  From the datatracker?  The Secretariat says
      they do not not have access to this historic data.

4.  Rationale

   We want the IESG to be staffed with the best possible people with the
   appropriate technical and management skills.  In order to achieve
   this, the job must be achievable, rewarding, and not an insufferable
   strain on the ADs.  But the high workload and constant stress mean
   that this is not always possible.

   At the same time, the ADs must be funded, and this is usually by
   their employers.  But, although some companies consider funding an AD
   as "paying the Internet tax," the companies are being asked to
   release the time of one of their key engineers for no or little
   direct return.  At the least, they hope that some of their employee's
   time will be available for work within the company; that is, that the
   AD job will not be a full time job.  Furthermore, as it is often
   claimed that an AD does not become fully effective until their second
   term, the role implies a commitment from the AD and their employer of
   at least four years.

   The current requirement is not sustainable, and leads to the
   centralization of technical leadership in only the largest companies
   -- those that can afford the costs and mitigate the loss of a key
   worker.  Of the 14 Area Directors in March 2023, eight (more than
   half) work for the one of the 2,000 largest global companies [FORBES]
   or a subsidiary.  Of course, this is a generalization -- there have
   been multiple ADs who came from Academia or worked for smaller
   companies.

   In order to make the AD positions (except for the IETF Chair) more
   accessible to candidates from different backgrounds and companies,
   the IETF needs to make the AD job less time-consuming.

      *TODO:* Look at previous IESG membership.

5.  Recommendations/Suggestions

5.1.  Only one AD to approve

   An Internet-Draft ballot should allow only one AD in each area to
   vote.  The other director(s) can either vote "no objection" or the
   ballot tracking can be modified to handle this more directly.
   Coordination between area ADs is left to them to handle; this
   document suggests that the _non-responsible_ AD be the one to vote.
   During discussion, all ADs should participate.

   For any area with a directorate, the default ballot position should
   be to accept that review, if one is given.

      *DISCUSSION* I'm not clear on this idea.  Is it based on a
      misunderstanding of the current requirements?  Currently, no AD is
      required to ballot on any document, although it might be
      considered as bad manners to not ballot.  However, a "no
      objection" doesn't require a review, and indeed many ADs trust
      their co-ADs or the sponsoring AD.  I believe that the IESG would
      respond in the same way: that the reviews are not the problem.

      This might, however, turn into advice and guidance phrased as
      "expectations and non-expectations for document review during IESG
      evaluation."  It could cover: - trusting other ADs - sharing
      review responsibilities between ADs - delegation of review to
      others such as Directorates - the meaning of "no objection"

      We might, however, look again at the number of "no objections"
      required for a ballot to pass on a standards track draft because
      it could be claimed that this puts additional pressure on ADs to
      do reviews.  I don't think this needs to be done, because I think
      that ADs need to understand better that "no objection" can be
      entered without doing a review.

5.2.  No "revisit" documents open across change-over

   Any ballots cast before an AD change-over should stand.  Notably, any
   DISCUSS issues, if resolved, should result in clearing and allowing
   the former AD to ballot.  This is similar to the NomCom term of
   office, which lasts until the next NomCom is seated.  Perhaps a time-
   limit of a year or six months should be added, allowing a reasonable
   time for the document queue to drain.

   An incoming AD would have to review the in-process draft, and while
   the number of such documents might be small, the potential impact on
   the amount of effort on the document authors, not to mention their
   morale -- "what, we have to do this again?" -- can be significant.

5.3.  Documents, not scheduling

   What is the rationale for the IESG setting meeting logistics?  How
   much time is consumed with scheduling?

   We have professional staff, with Board oversight, and consultations.
   The meeting venue requirements are being discussed as an update to
   [RFC8718] and any policy changes will be acted on.

      *DISCUSSION* Isn't this an example of the issue rather than the
      problem itself?  Should we rephrase this more along the line of
      "priorities"?  That is, once the ADs have done "facilitating" the
      work of the working groups, they are free to spend their time on
      anything they like.  But actually, the IESG would always say that
      they are making daily decisions about the priority of what they
      spend their time on.  They would say that one of their jobs is to
      look at the IETF and see what needs them to act, and that
      sometimes this results in documents being delayed in favour of
      other tasks.  So what is needed is to give the IESG instructions
      about priorities and what tasks to drop.  This can go further by
      listing the tasks that should be done by others, but it is hard to
      make such a long list: it is easier to list the tasks that should
      be done first.

5.4.  Content not language

   It is not an effective use of technical experts to review and correct
   for things like typos, etc.  We recognize that many ADs will be
   "unable to help themselves" as the personality trait of nit-picking
   is endemic to our profession, and they should feel free to point out
   nits, but they should be conscious of the time and effort involved.

   If a document lacks clarity or has so many issues with English that
   there is a risk of it being misunderstood, the AD should recognize
   this and feel free to send the document back to the WG for the
   authors to fix.  This may be hard, particularly for contributors
   where English is not their native language, but all working groups
   have the resources to help with this.

      *CITATION* I think it was the MPLS WG that instituted an English
      language review team.

   We also note that the existing RFC Production Center is already
   highly focused on copyediting.

6.  Increasing the candidate pool

   This document offers a number of suggestions to reduce the workload
   of an IETF Area Director, in the hopes that it will increase the
   diversity of candidates.

      *DISCUSSION* The IETF has learned to accomodate to remote
      meetings.  If in-person attendance at IESG meetings is perceived
      as a requirement, perhaps that should be explicitly discussed.

   This document offers some suggestions, in addition to reducing the
   workload, that might help increase the diversity of candidates.

6.1.  Reimburse travel

   Might help get more volunteers from other (less-wealthy? smaller
   companies?) parts of the world.

   We have learned to accommodate more remote meetings, perhaps that is
   enough.

      *DISCUSSION* I think that ADs feel they need to participate in
      person.  They might be helped by a discussion of this point.  If
      the travel budget really is an issue, then I think it is worth
      looking at, although I'd note that in order to be considered as an
      AD, someone has normally been attending IETF meetings in person,
      anyway.

6.2.  Pre-AD training

   "So you want to be an AD" could be worthwhile training to offer.  Of
   course the IESG and the way they work varies, and it would have to be
   done in consultation with them.

      *DISCUSSION* being careful that this is not an additional burden
      on the sitting ADs whose workload is too high! >>>>>>
